# ChatFind Minecraft Mod
Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 mod for my friend to find specific phrases in the chat and move them to the top of the screen, similar to a kill feed in shooter games such as CSGO and Valorant.

## How to use
1. Place ChatFind mod from releases in downloads folder.
2. Launch Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 or other modded client.
3. Close Minecraft.
4. Navigate to %APPDATA%/.minecraft folder and locate config folder.
5. Open chatfind.cfg.
6. Add/Remove/Change regex phrases after the "=" sign.
7. Launch Minecraft again. 

## Editting the Config File
* Add/Remove/Change regex phrases after the "=" sign.
* Change delay by changing the delay value to a number in milliseconds. 5000 milliseconds is 5 seconds. 5 milliseconds is 0.005 seconds.
* Separate them with commas (,) only. DO NOT include spaces.

## Keybinds
P - Clears screen of messages. This cannot be changed at the moment.   
O - Reloads config file
